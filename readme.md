Here is an example of a script I created to automate the weekly spreadsheet creation when I was working as a data analyst/science intern at BCI. 

The script pulls in multiple unstructured data sources and manipulates/aggregates them to produce one spreadsheet with the call center agent metrics.

This was fundamental for relieving technical managers from manually creating this spreadsheet and allowing any employee to produce or distribute it. 

The entire script is written in Python using packages like Pandas and NumPy.

Confidential information has been removed or masked with arbitrary values.

The script is contained in the .py file and an example of the output is contained in the .png file.
